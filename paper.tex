We present a method to design graphs that satisfy multiple objective 
functions based on sampling by a graph grammar.
    
    Sample objective functions are based on neighbors of the target
in the training set: one base on the distance to the target, one to prevent
excessive growth during sampling and one that combines the vectorized neighbours
to penalize sampling in a different direction (in hyperspace :D ).
 We evaluate our method
on chemical compounds and random graphs generated according to a new technique
that generates graphs with a hidden pattern.

% OVERVIEW
\section{Methods}
Given a set of graph instances and objective functions, 
design a graph that satisfies all objective functions. 
We first find high scoring graphs in the instance set. We use these to extract a graph grammar. 
The high scoring graphs are used as starting input for the following loop: 
score graphs, 
select high scoring graphs, 
generate all possible neighbors according to the grammar, 
remove duplicates.

\textbf{Scoring and Selecting Graphs}
After all graphs are scored by every objective function. We keep the best instances for 
each function.  
Duplicates are removed by using a graph kernel and hashing every graph. 
Collisions are easily found and the associated graphs removed.

% GRAPH GRAMMAR
\subsection{Graph Grammar}
The highest scoring Graphs are further explored by generating all neighbors according to 
the grammar. A graph grammar is defined as a finite set of productions $S=(M,D,E)$ where in 
a host graph $H$ the ``Mother" graph $M$ is replaced by the ``Daughter" graph $D$ via an 
embedding mechanism $E$. We describe the grammar of Costa \cite{costa16gl} in the context of our application.
The grammar is extracted from what we assume to be the closest neighbors to our target.

For every node in the graph set we extract a ``core interface pair", CIP as follows.
Assuming a root node $r$, 
the subgraph induces by the nodes $\{ n | d(n,r) < radius+distance \}$ is the CIP.
The subgraph covering the nodes $\{ n | d(n,r) < radius \}$ is the core, while the subgraph covering
$\{ n | n \notin core , n \in CIP \}$ is the interface.
CIPs with isomorphic interfaces are called congruent.
A production would be applied by identifying a CIP in the Host graph, 
removing the core part and inserting the 
new core by contracting every node in the interface 
with their respective partner according to the bijection.

Edges-labels are considered by adding an additional node with the appropriate labels and edges to
a graph. For radius and distance variables we consider graphs to be expanded.
Since interface graphs can be hashed, it is easy to find possible
candidates for the application of a production. 

% RECONSTRUCT ALGORITHM 

\subsection{Graph Kernel}
% WTH IS A GRAPH LERNEL, y amn i using eden
We use the NSPDK graph kernel package ``EDeN" ~\cite{costa2010fast}. NSPDK is a Weisfeiler Lehman \cite{weisfeiler}
kernel with the twist that neighborhood subgraphs are considered in pairs.

The Kernel has two parameters: radius $r$ and distance $d$. Given a node $v$ it extracts features for $v$ according to 
$\{ h(h_g(N^s(v)),h_g(N^s(w))) | s \in \{0..r\} \wedge 0 \leq
distance(v,w) \leq d  \wedge w\in V \}$.  Where $h$ is a hash function and 
$h_g$ a hash function on graphs. $N^s$ extracts the neighborhood subgraph of a
vertex in radus $s$. Note that the hash values themselves are features and the feature
vectors are very sparse. In the default setting EDeN will normalize the resulting vector.

\subsection{Objective Functions}
% a few intro words maybe...

The main objective function is trained on graphs from the training set we call 
\emph{landmarks} $L$ and their distance to the target. 
Given a graph $v$ to score, we calculate the euclidean distances to the landmarks. We then subtract 
the desired distances and give the average of these distances 
$ {1 \over{\#L} }\sum_{l \in L} |d(v,l)|$.
% why not squared distances?  -> test on BINAC

% i hope i got the rank estimator right...
Another objective considers the ranks of the landmarks. A SVM is trained 
with the pairwise difference between the landmark graphs. If we subtract a closer instance
from an instance farther away the result belongs in the positive class and vice versa.
% considering that the vectors lay on a ball it makes sense to expect that the general direction of 
% landmarks which are by definition close to the target is good to explore versus the opposite direction
%, right?


%Size 
Using the grammar approach to graph generation results in our experience in 
inflated graph sizes also aiming for a graph about the size of the landmarks is a good guess.
Therefore we give a score based on the size of the input; $|size(v) - {1\over{\#L}} \sum_{l \in L} size(l)|$.

%special
Additionally we use rank the graphs according to the sum of the ranks of the previous objectives.
